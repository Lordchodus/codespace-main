# 1. Plan functions: make a bullet list of the actions and helpers you’ll need.
# 2. Start coding: write the pantry dictionary and your first function (like add_snack).
# 3. Build out actions: add remove and list features, with careful error checks.
# 4. Add input validation: make sure users can’t add “-5 Oreos” or “ ” as a snack.
# 5. Testing: write at least 3 small tests for your helpers.
# 6. Polish: run through a main loop for user interaction, then clean up prints.
