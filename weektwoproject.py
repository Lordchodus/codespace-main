# Write a program called Score Tracker.
# It should:
# Repeatedly ask the user to enter a score until they type done.
# Validate each score:
# Must be a number.
# Must be from 0 to 100 (inclusive).
# If not valid, keep asking until a valid score or done.
# Store every valid score in a list.
# When the user types done, print:
# The minimum score.
# The maximum score.
# The average score (to two decimals).
# The sorted list of scores.
# Must use:
# A loop for input.
# List methods like append and sort.
# An f-string for the formatted average.
